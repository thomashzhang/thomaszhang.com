These notes are based on the [MongoDB Cluster Administration](https://university.mongodb.com/mercury/M103/2020_March_31/overview) course at [MongoDB University](https://university.mongodb.com/) and they hold the rights to all the original materials. I try to summarize and add additional insight from my own experience.
