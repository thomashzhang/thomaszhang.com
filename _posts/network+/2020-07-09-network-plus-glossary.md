As I go through course material, study sessions, exploratory sessions, I will list all of the terms that have come up in a master alphabetized glossary list.

**Disclaimer**: These are notes I'm taking as I go through the material and I tend to summarize, paraphrase and add my own insights. Although I try to be as accurate as possible, there may be things I've misunderstood. Additionally, since I'm not writing a paper here, I may quote definitions I've found on various sites. If you see any mistakes and would like to fix them, please create a PR [here](https://github.com/thomashzhang/thomaszhang.com).

- **PAN (Personal Area Network)** - A type of network generally in a much smaller range. As an example, a bluetooth watch connected to your phone is considered a personal area network.
