As I go through course material, study sessions, exploratory sessions, I will list all of the terms that have come up in a master alphabetized glossary list.

**Disclaimer**: These are notes I'm taking as I go through the material and I tend to summarize, paraphrase and add my own insights. Although I try to be as accurate as possible, there may be things I've misunderstood. Additionally, since I'm not writing a paper here, I may quote definitions I've found on various sites. I do want to mention that I used this [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptiacsaplus) for some of the definitions. If you see any mistakes and would like to fix them, please create a PR [here](https://github.com/thomashzhang/thomaszhang.com).

- **Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis** - Describes cyber attacks in the shape of a diamond with four parts: Adversary, Infrastructure, Capability, Target.
- **EDR** - Endpoint Detection and Response.
- **ERM** - Enterprise Risk Management.
- **IoC** - Indicators of Compromise.
- **Runbook** - Automated version of a playbook.
