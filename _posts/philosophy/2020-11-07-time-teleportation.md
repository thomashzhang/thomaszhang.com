**Time Teleportation** (TT) is a theoretical type of teleportation that is achieved by using multiple simultaneous time dimensions (TD) to create the illusion of teleportation.

That's a mouthful of words, but how does it actually work? Let's break it down in a couple of very simple steps without any complex terminology:

1. Stop time everywhere, except around your immediate person.
2. Move from point A to point B
3. Start time.

Notice that if this is done correctly, from the outside observer, it would appear as if you've teleported from point A to point B. From their time perspective, you got there instantly. From your time perspective, everyone was frozen and you simply walked from point A to point B.

Here are the same steps, but a little more detailed:

1. You create a spacial bubble (B1) that wraps around your person exactly and set your bubble's TD to TD1, where the passage of time is equal to 1x the currently known passage of time (CKPT)
2. The spacial inverse of B1, the rest of the known universe, you set the TD to TD2, where the passage of time is 0 (`1x CKPT = 0x in TD2`).
3. At this point, you can observe that everything and everyone around you has stopped moving relative to you. There are a couple of caveats to mention:
   1. Since you control the spacial scope of B1, you are free to incorporate parts of B1 inverse into B1. A good example here would be to incorporate the air immediately around B1 to allow yourself to breath and also incorporate the ground immediately below you to allow friction to take place.
      1. You may also incorporate objects such as cars to get to your destination a little faster in your relative time frame.
   2. You still age at CKPT, so the longer you stay in B1, the longer you would've aged in comparison to everyone else.
   3. Your TD should follow B1 as closely as possible if not instantaneous. It can be very dangerous if your TD does not fully incorporate B1 as you may bump into immoveable objects and that could cause great bodily harm.
4. Move from point A to point B
5. Set the TD of B1 inverse to CKPT.
6. From the perspective of an observer that was in B1 inverse, you have teleported from point A to point B.
   1. From your perspective, you've simply walked from point A to point B
   2. Note that continually performing this type of teleportation will cause great time deltas between B1 and B1 inverse. You may want to perform the opposite operation from time to time to decrease the time deltas. Ideally if you lock yourself in a room where you are unable to be disturbed, you may set B1 inverse's TD to TD1 and B1's TD to TD2 for a period of time. From your perspective, the clock moved forward an hour instantly. To not raise any suspicions, it's often best to claim you were sleeping for that hour (even though you've gotten no rest).

With any type of theoretical teleportation, certain assumptions must be made to allow for the teleportation to actually happen. The biggest assumption made here is that [F-Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-theory), a branch of string theory which predicts 10-12 physical dimensions and allows for multiple time dimensions, is an accurate description of our world.
